"they love me... *plucks a petal*... they love me not.... *plucks a petal*.... they love me!"

Online dating is so stressful.  "Are they into me?", "Am I being ghosted?", "Am I being KINDLY CANADIAN ghosted??" Who knows!  Sentiment analysis is hard!  This project is an attempt to use hidden markov models (HMM) and Kalman filters to make a model for romantic sentiment analysis in the context of online dating interactions... it'll also be a good distraction from my own speculative mind ramblings within my dating life lol
